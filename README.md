# Hands-On Machine Learning Practice

## Overview
This repository contains my personal practice and experiments inspired by  
*Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow (2nd Edition)*.  
All code is implemented, modified, and documented by me to deepen understanding  
of machine learning and deep learning concepts, and to prepare for remote AI/data projects.

## Goals
- Strengthen practical ML/DL skills with Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras
- Apply theoretical concepts to real datasets
- Build a portfolio suitable for digital nomad / remote work opportunities
